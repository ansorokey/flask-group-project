Hello! I've never used a service like this before, so I'm not entirely sure what I should be taking note of here.

I'll do my best to give an objective opinion and my experience as a brand new freelancer using the application for the first time.

For this review, let's say I'm a 68 year old retired plumber fixing up pipes around my neighborhood. I call my son's PS5 'the nintendo'.

PLEASE NOTE: A lot of this may be excessive. By all means, pick and choose what you feel like would contribute to an overall better experience. Your vision, not mine.

# Landing page as a guest:
As a new user, I can read that this is clearly a CRM website, and I like the section that tells you why Bantam handles my needs.
Maybe between that and the 'What our users say' section, add a few screenshots with captions of the application in use?
Show me what a client list might look like, show me appointments in my calendar, show me tasks and notes.
Basically a demo user preview, without having to become a member.
It would get me to sign up, AND show me how exactly the app is intended to be used.

# Dashboard as a freelancer
I like being able to see my appointments and tasks right off the bat.
When I have no appointments or tasks, I'd like to be able to quickly add something in from the dashboard. Maybe a small '+ New Task or '+ New Appintment' button in the corner of the TASK or UPCOMING APPOINTMENT displays. It could open the form or just be a link to that part of the site.

I can't seem to find where to add an appointment, actually. So that would save a lot of navigation confusion.
Update: I see now that an appointment can only be made when you have a client. Same with tasks. That makes sense, but is a little confusing at first. I'd recommend adding in some placeholder text. If the appointment list is empty: show me something like 'Add a client to start scheduling appointments'.

Maybe the same thing for clients. It woold be cool to see maybe my 3ish most recently added clients, as well as an '+ New Client' button. I see its in the profile button drop down, but a dashboard button would feel a little more intuitive.

My eyes are old, the font beneath Hey There User being even 2px bigger is nice.
INCREDIBLY minor, but adding an 's' after tasks if I have more than 1 task due
1 task due
2 tasks due

# Clients Page
If I only have one client, seeing a name in the top left of the page almost makes me think that's my name/account. A nice header at the top of that list that says 'My Clients' would be nice.

I wasn't sure what the white checkbox did so I clicked it out of curiosity. It doesn't scream 'Click this to mark as complete'. Something as simple as an html title attribute on the checkbox that says 'mark as complete?' would be a big help.
When I do mark a client task as completed, I have NO IDEA how to get it back. It disappears into the upside down.
Rather than completely hiding it from view, maybe add another section to that task display?

```
TASKS

In Progress / Completed
```

Rather than a '?' button, I'd rather click on the task body to see the details, similar to the functionality you have on a client's notes. The '?' button feels more like the button on turbotax that explains a confusing IRS word.

# Task page
I like the color coding for priority on the '?' button, but I'd rather see that on the entire orange bar. That would make it pop a lot more, and be visually distinguishable.

# Calendar
This thing blows my mind, how did you make this??? Amazing.

I'd like the little bar representing the current time on the week/day section to be like...2 pixels taller. Or maybe like a little carrot at the front
`>---------`
Just so it's a little easier to spot

On the week display, there's a 10px margin on the 'rbc-events-container'. Unless that 10px does something functionally, I think the event going edge to edge looks a little nicer!

In the agenda, I didn't realize I could click the events and see the details. I thought it was just a list.I'd recommend making the events visually clickable. A pointer cursor, hover effect - just something small to communicate interaction!
